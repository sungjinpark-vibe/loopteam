# Loop Journal

Append-only. One entry per tick, newest at the bottom. Never rewrite history here.

**Why this exists:** the loop's conversation context is summarized and eventually lost, but the loop
keeps running. This journal is how a future tick — with none of today's context — finds out what was
already tried, what failed, and why a decision was made. Write for that reader: they have no memory
of this and cannot ask you.

Keep entries short. Record **decisions and outcomes**, not narration.

## Format

```
## Tick <n> — <YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm>
- did: <what happened this tick>
- task: <T### | none>
- result: <passed in N rounds | escalated | idle | replied>
- note: <anything a future tick needs that isn't obvious from the backlog>
```

---

## Tick 0 — engine bootstrap
- did: Loop engine scaffolded (agents, quality loop, backlog, state, Discord channel ported from
  app-dev-team with its own bot identity).
- task: none
- result: idle — no app assigned yet, backlog empty.
- note: Discord bot token not yet configured (`.discord/config.json`). The loop cannot report to the
  director until that exists.

## Tick 0b — audit against 《루프 엔지니어링》 (김동학, wikidocs.net/book/20486)
- did: Read ch.12 (Verify), 13 (State file), 14 (Stop condition), 18 (4파일 시스템), 29 (조용히
  실패하는 Loop). Audited the engine against the book's named failure patterns and rebuilt what failed.
- result: 5 real gaps found and closed.
- findings:
  - **Nodding Loop (29장) — the serious one.** The v1 quality loop's only gate was a 3-agent LLM judge
    panel. The book is explicit that this is opinion, not verification: "낙관적인 에이전트 둘이 서로
    고개만 끄덕이는 셈". Replaced with a two-stage gate: `gate/gate.ps1` (exit code, mechanical) must
    pass BEFORE `evaluator` scores a fixed rubric out of 100. Judges kept only for `explore` mode,
    where the output is a document and no mechanical signal exists.
  - **Goal Drift (29장)** — no direction doc existed; CLAUDE.md described the team, not the mission.
    Added `VISION.md`, re-read every tick per the book's prescription.
  - **Ralph Wiggum Loop (12·14장)** — success brake was an agent's opinion. Now: mechanical PASS + 95
    points. Added the missing failure brakes: 5-round hard limit + no-progress detection (±2 over 3 rounds).
  - **Amnesiac Loop (13·18장)** — had journal/backlog but no cockpit and no **Do Not Repeat**.
    Added `state/PROGRESS.md` with the book's section set.
  - **No failure policy (18장)** — "나쁜 Loop 대부분은 실패 정책이 없다. 그래서 에이전트가 즉흥적으로
    판단한다." Added `VISION.md` 5절 as a fixed table.
- verified: gate tested end-to-end on a throwaway Flutter project — FAILs closed on missing app dir and
  missing pubspec, PASSes a healthy project (exit 0), FAILs an injected type error with the exact line
  (exit 1). It discriminates; it is not decoration.
- note: **Tangled Loop (24장) does not apply** — the build loop runs a single implementer, and explore
  mode's parallel agents return text without writing files. No worktree needed. Revisit only if
  implementers are ever parallelized.
- note: 18장 says do not schedule a loop before it runs cleanly by hand. That applies to the LOOP
  (`/loop /tick`), which stays manual until `/tick` proves out by hand. It does not apply to the
  Discord listener's watchdog — that is messaging infrastructure, not the loop, and it must be up
  before a brief can even arrive. (Registered in Tick 0c.)

## Tick 0c — Discord channel live
- did: Wired the director's channel. Bot `Loop_team` (id 1526972090203504700) → `#loop-team`.
  Verified auth, channel access, send, and no self-echo. Registered scheduled task
  `LoopEngine-DiscordDaemon-Watchdog` (1 min) and proved self-heal by killing the daemon — the
  watchdog revived it (PID 14356 → 10752). Three project listeners now coexist without collision.
- result: channel ready; loop can report. Waiting on the director's first brief.
- found + fixed: **Discord cursor bug**, inherited latent from app-dev-team. `le-daemon.ps1` skipped
  the bot's own messages with `continue` BEFORE advancing `$lastId`, so our own sends never moved the
  cursor. Since `?after=<id>&limit=100` returns the OLDEST 100 after the cursor, an autonomous loop —
  which reports far more often than the director replies — would fill that window with its own reports
  and never read the director's next message, waiting forever on an approval already given. Chat-driven
  use hides this; a loop walks straight into it. Fixed by advancing the cursor for every message and
  filtering only the logging. Verified: last-id went 0 → real message id after the fix.
- note: the same bug is still live in app-dev-team's `discord-daemon.ps1`. Logged under Needs Human
  Review — not ours to change unasked.
- note: `loopteam` repo still does not exist on GitHub; engine is committed locally only. gh CLI is not
  installed and credential extraction was (correctly) blocked, so the director must create it.

## Tick 0d — receive verified; app-dev-team left alone
- did: Director sent two "테스트" messages; both landed in incoming.log and last-id advanced to the
  newest. Full round trip now proven: send, receive, cursor advance, self-heal.
- decision: Offered to fix the same cursor bug in app-dev-team's daemon. **Director said no
  ("건드리지 마"). Closed — do not propose it again.** Recorded in PROGRESS.md → Do Not Repeat.
  The bug stays live there; that project is chat-driven, so it is far less exposed than a loop.
- did: Marked the two test messages as handled so the first real tick does not mistake "테스트" for a
  project brief.
- result: engine ready. Waiting on the director's first brief. Nothing blocking.

## Tick 0e — engine complete; team wakes on restart
- did: Tried to validate the loop by hand (18장: prove it by hand before scheduling). Attempted to run
  `loop-scout` and it failed: "Agent type 'loop-scout' not found".
- cause: Claude Code reads `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` at session start. This session began
  before those files existed, so the team is not registered in it. Not a defect in the files —
  frontmatter names all verified against filenames.
- result: **The engine is complete but unexercised. The first real `/tick` must run in a fresh Claude
  Code session.** Recorded in PROGRESS.md → Next Run Should step 0.
- what IS verified: mechanical gate end-to-end (passes healthy, catches an injected error, fails
  closed); Discord round trip (send, receive, cursor advance, no self-echo, watchdog self-heal);
  repo pushed to loopteam with no token in history; all agent references in quality-loop.js resolve.
- what is NOT verified: a full tick, and the two gates running against a real task. Nothing has been
  built by this team yet.

## Tick 1 — 2026-07-16 00:45 — first real tick
- did: Read VISION.md + PROGRESS.md, checked kill switch (paused:false), delegated to `loop-scout`.
- task: none
- result: **IDLE** — no brief has arrived; VISION.md §2 is still the template, backlog is empty.
- note: This tick existed to test one property: **does the loop invent work when there is none?**
  It does not. The scout read the inbox, found both messages already handled, found an empty backlog,
  and returned IDLE with an honest reason rather than manufacturing a task to look useful. That is the
  correct behavior and the whole reason for the "브리프 없으면 일을 만들지 말 것" rule.
- note: Team loaded correctly after the Claude Code restart — 9 agents + the /tick skill. The
  "Agent type not found" failure from Tick 0e was purely the session-start registration issue.
- note: Cleaned up a Do Not Repeat entry that was worded as "don't check the git toplevel", which read
  as discouraging a safety check. Rewrote it to say what was actually meant: never `git add` from the
  home folder. Do Not Repeat is binding, so a confusingly worded entry there is a real liability.
- what is still unexercised: the two gates against a real task. Nothing has been built yet.

## Tick 1b — 2026-07-16 — director rules 1-5; stack switched to Unity
- did: Adopted five standing director rules (recorded in `VISION.md` §7).
- rules: ① permissions follow the parent `.claude/settings.json` ② always use rtk ③ English for
  everything except director reports ④ token-efficient ⑤ **Unity only** (MCP later, once a project
  exists).
- decided with director: rtk needs no new work — the global settings already hook Bash/PowerShell
  through `rtk hook claude`, so shell output is token-filtered automatically. VISION.md/PROGRESS.md
  translated to English; the director reads the rubric on Discord in Korean instead, which matches the
  standing "the director does not read files" principle.
- **Gate 1 rewritten for Unity.** The Flutter gate is gone — the stack is fixed now.
  - Verified batchmode works on this PC and the license activates (exit 0, project created).
  - **Unity exits 0 with compile errors is real and dangerous.** The gate therefore judges compilation
    by exit code AND an `error CS####` log scan; either failing fails the gate. Tested: healthy
    project → exit 0; two injected compile errors → exit 1 with exact file/line. It discriminates.
  - The gate refuses to open a project whose editor version differs, rather than silently upgrading it.
  - Found and fixed: `Start-Process -PassThru` returns an EMPTY `.ExitCode` unless `$p.Handle` is
    touched before exit — it made every compile look inconclusive. The gate failed closed rather than
    passing, which is the correct behavior, but the cause is now fixed.
- swept every instruction file for Flutter/Pixel_9 leftovers (CLAUDE.md, tick skill, quality-loop,
  client-dev, gate-runner). Leaving them would have been textbook Goal Drift: the next tick reads
  CLAUDE.md and would have reached for Flutter while VISION.md said Unity.
- result: engine consistent on Unity. Still waiting on the director's first brief.
- **still unexercised**: the two gates against a real task. No game exists yet, and Unity MCP is not
  connected (deliberate — nothing to install it into).

## Tick 1c — 2026-07-16 — roles restructured (director rules 6-8)
- did: Rebuilt the gate structure from two gates to three, per director rules 6-8.
  - **Gate 2 is now the team lead at 90.** Every team is member + lead; the lead scores its own
    member's deliverable against that team's fixed rubric (`VISION.md` §3.2 — five rubrics written).
  - **Gate 3 is new: a 5-expert playtest panel** that ends app development. avg ≥90 AND nobody <80.
  - Gate 1 (mechanical) untouched — it is the only non-opinion signal in the whole system.
- **The floor is the real design decision.** `95·94·92·90·79` averages to exactly 90. That 79 is one
  expert saying something is badly wrong, and an average would ship it. The floor is what makes a
  five-expert panel better than one grader instead of just more expensive.
- retired: `evaluator` (single 95-point grader) and `judge`. Superseded. `explore` proposals are now
  scored by that team's own lead against the same rubric — one consistent standard per deliverable
  rather than an ad-hoc panel per mode.
- built: `team-lead` and `game-expert` as **2 generic agents**, not 10. Rubrics and the expert panel
  live in `VISION.md` §3.2/§3.3 and are passed per call. The director tunes the bar in one file, and
  near-duplicate agent files cannot drift apart. New workflow: `playtest.js`.
- guarded (ch.26): a lead is structurally on their team's side, which is the whole danger. Leads are
  given the deliverable and the rubric and **never the member's reasoning** — understanding *why* a
  shortcut was taken is exactly what makes a grader generous.
- **declined**: the director allowed per-member Discord bots for team chatter but flagged the token
  cost. Rejected — agents already exchange structured data inside the workflow, and Discord chatter
  would refill the listener's 100-message window, re-creating the cursor bug fixed the same day (the
  director's next brief stops being read). Recorded in `VISION.md` §6.
- rule 8 adopted: **Discord is the channel** for all director requests, result summaries, and
  permission/approval requests. It does not license blocking — send, mark `awaiting-approval`, and move
  to the next `ready` task.
- swept stale references (`evaluator`/`judge`/95/passMark) out of CLAUDE.md, the tick skill, BACKLOG,
  and server-dev. Leaving them is how Goal Drift starts.
- verified: both workflows parse; every `agentType` they call resolves to a real agent file.
- **still unexercised**: all three gates against a real task. No game exists yet.

## Tick 2 — 2026-07-16 06:45 — REPLY (tooling research)
- did: Scout drained the inbox and classified the director's 06:30 message as a question, correctly
  refusing to stretch a tooling request into a game brief. PM researched and replied on Discord.
- task: none (REPLY)
- result: replied.
- **why the director saw no answer for hours**: the listener was healthy the whole time and the message
  was sitting in `incoming.log` since 06:30. Nothing read it because **no tick was running**. Discord is
  an inbox, not a chat — the loop must be turning for anything to happen. `/loop /tick` was never
  started (deliberately: prove it by hand first, then the session ended). This is the failure mode the
  autonomous loop exists to remove, demonstrated live.
- findings (recommendation): the team already has what it needs — rtk is already hooked, 17 community
  skills installed. **One thing worth adding: the OFFICIAL Unity MCP** (`com.unity.ai.assistant`,
  needs Unity 6000.0+; we are on 6000.5.1f1 — verified in Unity's own docs). It would let QA read
  scene/console/tests directly instead of a 30-90s batchmode round trip, which is where Gate 3's
  evidence cost lives. Still pre-release (2.7.0-pre.3).
- **⚠️ real conflict found**: Unity MCP needs a **running Editor**, and a running Editor **holds the
  project lock** — the exact thing that makes `gate/gate.ps1` fail. Turning MCP on naively would break
  Gate 1 every run. Recorded in Do Not Repeat; the sequencing must be designed when the project is
  created, not discovered after the gate starts failing.
- declined: third-party Unity MCPs (CoplayDev, CoderGamester) — the official one exists.
- next: starting `/loop /tick` so the inbox is actually read from now on.

## Tick 3 — 2026-07-16 08:40 — first project brief; T001 launched
- did: Monitor fired on the director's 08:25 message — the loop woke on the event, not on the 30-min
  heartbeat. That is the responsiveness fix working.
- task: T001 (explore, planner) — spec the Life Town Unity rebuild
- result: project created, T001 running.
- brief: rebuild `lifetown` in Unity, but "make it better achieve the app's purpose" — not a port.
- **survey finding (delegated, read-only)**: the repo notes claimed lifetown "shipped through v0.0.5".
  **It never shipped** — that is an internal label; debug signing, test AdMob IDs, no developer account.
  It is 34,344 lines / 210 files / 27 screens of real, polished work. But **the integrity system does
  not exist**: no caps, no focus enforcement, no clock-tamper defense, and **no server at all** (no
  Cloud Functions). `economy.dart:10-12` admits it. The spec marks all of it Must.
- **the insight worth keeping**: the purpose is "내 시간과 노력을 눈에 보이게". If the timer can be
  cheated, the village mirrors nothing and becomes decoration — the purpose collapses. Making the
  village *trustworthy* may serve the brief more than any feature. **Not assumed** — handed to planner
  as one of three competing angles (trust / feel / ship) for the lead to score.
- scope deliberately NOT decided by the PM. 34k lines is not automatically the MVP; that is the
  director's call, and the winning proposal will go to Discord for approval.
- **three infrastructure bugs found and fixed** (all in our own code/usage, see Do Not Repeat):
  1. `meta` must be a pure literal — our `whenToUse` used `'a' + 'b'` concatenation. A broken meta makes
     a workflow **invisible**, so `name:` lookup says "not found" and *looks* like a discovery problem.
     Nearly recorded as the wrong lesson before both workflows appeared by name once meta parsed.
  2. `args` arrives as a **JSON string**, not an object — verified with both a large and a minimal
     payload. Died before any agent ran. Both workflows now coerce it.
  3. `Start-Process -PassThru` empty `.ExitCode` (fixed earlier, Tick 1b).
- note: Unity project created via batchmode (exit 0) and git-initialised with a Unity .gitignore —
  24 files tracked, Library/ excluded. Root `.gitignore` now excludes `/lifetown/`.

## Tick 3b — 2026-07-16 09:00 — T001 scored 83, rejected; explore revise loop added
- task: T001 (explore, planner)
- result: **NOT passed.** Best of 3 proposals scored **83/90**. 기획팀장 refused it.
- **the gate worked.** An 83 was not waved through as "basically there". That refusal is the whole
  reason this system exists — worth recording as evidence the bar is real, not decoration.
- winner: SHIP-FIRST. Its thesis: the original's failure was not missing features — it was 34,344
  lines / 27 screens / 61 test files reaching **zero players in a year**. Cut to 7 screens, ship a
  signed build to a store track in week 1, and treat "a stranger installed it and logged a session"
  as the only definition of done.
- lead's deductions (specific and fair):
  - **-4 P2: the integrity position is unimplementable as written.** The whole trust argument rests on
    a monotonic clock, and the spec never says how to get one in Unity (no SystemClock.elapsedRealtime
    JNI call, no Editor fallback, no injection seam). The lead's own words: that makes 관문 1
    decoration on the exact subsystem the proposal argued hardest for. Sharp catch.
  - -2 P1: defers the '보이게' half of the purpose; -2 P1: a 30-min "still there?" ping is policing,
    contradicting a target user defined as "무거운 생산성 앱엔 지친 사람".
  - -2 P2: ui-ux cannot start (village art direction unresolved); -3 P3: weakest return hook, admits it;
    -2 P3: ships a known-broken economy axis (25 min = Lv1→Lv5); -1 P4: 8-week timeline optimistic;
    -1 P5: cut Landmark without flagging it overrides a locked decision.
- **bug found in our own workflow**: `VISION.md` §5 says "Gate 2 below 90 → take the deductions, fix,
  re-score" — but **explore mode had no revise loop**. It escalated on the spot. Build mode revised;
  explore did not. Contract and code disagreed, and the code was wrong.
- fixed: explore now revises the winner with the lead's deductions + the losers' grafts, re-scores, and
  carries the same no-progress brake. Resumed via `resumeFromRunId` so the 3 proposals and round-1
  scoring replay from cache — no re-burn of 241k tokens.
- also fixed: the success path reported round-1 `perCriterion`, which goes stale after a revision.
- cost so far on T001: 4 agents, 241k subagent tokens, ~15 min.

## Tick 4 — 2026-07-16 09:15 — T001 PASSED 93; awaiting director approval
- task: T001 (explore, planner)
- result: **PASSED 93/90.** scoreHistory [83, 93], 2 rounds. Spec written to
  `lifetown/docs/spec/00-mvp-spec.md` (81,839 bytes) and committed to the app repo.
- score: P1 24/25 · P2 23/25 · P3 18/20 · **P4 15/15** · P5 13/15
- **the revise loop paid for itself immediately.** The bug I fixed this same tick was the difference
  between shipping an 83 as an escalation and shipping a 93. The lead's own round-2 note: "The prior
  round's two blockers are gone. §7.3 makes the load-bearing monotonic clock implementable."
- resume worked as designed: `workflowProgress` confirms the 3 proposals + round-1 lead replayed from
  cache (`cached: true`) and only revise + re-score ran live. 133k tokens instead of another 241k.
- **the planner found the thing nobody had measured**: Google Play personal developer accounts need
  **12 opted-in testers for 14 continuous days** before production. Unshortenable by coding, never on
  anyone's plan. At every moment of that year the original was — at best — an account + 12 humans + 14
  days away from a player. **That is why it sat at zero.** Shipping is now the longest-lead step and
  starts in week 1, before the product exists.
- other findings worth keeping:
  - The director's own 07-11 EXP curve `[0,30,120,360,1000]` lets one 25-min session take a building
    Lv1→Lv5 max, killing the EXP axis after session 1. The spec defaults to **his own earlier 07-10
    value**, not a planner's invention, and flags it. That is the right way to not-drift.
  - Landmark arithmetic: 2 × Tier2 Lv10 = ~25 h of logged time. A 14-day test at 1 h/day = 14 h.
    **No tester can reach one.** Cutting it is not laziness; building it would be content for zero humans.
  - D9: the spec was explicitly *permitted* to pay leisure less, and refused — "a leisure penalty is
    the exact mechanism that converts a neutral mirror back into a productivity app, quietly, through a
    constant, with no document ever saying so." Surfaced as the director's call rather than taken.
- **note on the count**: 14 of the original's 27 screens (52%) are social + mini-games, both locked
  OUT of MVP. The team built the half locked out and skipped the half locked in. §11.3 of the new spec
  asks for the MVP scope to become a `VISION.md` boundary so the gate can reject that — worth doing.
- next: awaiting the director. T001 is `awaiting-approval`; nothing else is `ready`, so the loop idles.
  Blocking answer is D7. D1 and D11 override locked decisions and need explicit approval.

## Tick 5 — 2026-07-16 10:00 — STOPPED at the director's request
- did: Monitor fired on the director's 09:58 message. Scout read it: **"멈춰줘"**.
- task: none
- result: **loop halted.** `paused: true`, `/loop` stopped, Monitor stopped. Discord listener left
  running (director rule: "작업 끝나면 리스너 켜줘") so messages keep landing while the loop sleeps.
- **the scout got the important part right**: it did NOT read "멈춸줘" as approval. T001 stays
  `awaiting-approval` with D1/D5/D7/D9/D11 all unanswered. An unanswered decision is not an approved
  one, and a stop command is not a yes. That distinction is exactly what a tired loop would blur.
- `handled.txt` advanced to the stop message, so a resume starts clean from whatever comes after it
  rather than re-reading "멈춰줘" as new work.
- state at halt: both repos committed and pushed, 0 uncommitted. T001 passed at 93 and its spec is in
  `lifetown/docs/spec/00-mvp-spec.md`. Nothing in flight, nothing half-done.
- to resume: set `paused: false`, then `/tick` or `/loop /tick`.

## Tick 6 — 2026-07-16 16:15 — RESUMED; T001 approved w/ overrides; T002 launched
- did: Director un-paused via "루프 다시 시작". Confirmed the listener held all messages during the halt.
- inbox: director answered the approval (msg 1527210387135528991, 16:08) + sent "/loop".
- **T001 APPROVED with overrides.** Answers → D-numbers:
  - D5 = accept planner → EXP curve [0,60,240,720,2000]
  - D9 = accept planner → leisure ×1.0
  - D1 = **keep cloud sync** (director's "4,5는 유지" = keep the features; PM confirmed via AskUserQuestion)
  - D11 = **keep landmarks**
  - D7 = **defer the dev account; build only** ("일단 만들기만"; PM confirmed "출시는 나중, 일단 만들기만")
- **honest consequence, told to the director plainly**: these overrides invert the spec's *ship-first
  thesis* (cut hard, ship week 1). But they are internally coherent — D7 (no ship) dissolves the very
  objections behind cutting D1/D11 ("no 14-day test → no one-reaches-25h problem, no device-loss-for-12
  -testers problem"). The spec's scaffolding survives; only its thesis + scope-cuts are overridden.
  Scope is now LARGER than the 93-pt spec; its 8-9 week timeline is void; completion is now Gate 3
  (5-expert playtest), not a store install. Recorded in docs/spec/01-decisions-resolved.md (newer
  record wins on conflicts) and VISION.md §2.
- **build sequencing (PM call)**: build the decision-stable spine first — the parts no decision touched.
  T002 = Economy.Core (pure C#, no UnityEngine): monotonic-clock seam, economy w/ D5+D9 baked in, I1-I7
  clamps, session commit. Fully unit-testable → the ideal first mechanical-gate target. Cloud sync (D1)
  and landmarks (D11) are additive and become their own later tasks; the core loop needs neither.
- **bug hit**: build mode also requires `rubric` (not just explore). Forgot it; workflow died 5ms, 0
  agents. Re-launched with C1-C5 from VISION.md §3.2. Recorded in Do Not Repeat.
- T001 → done. T002 → in-progress. Monitor re-armed (was stopped at the halt).

## Tick 7 — 2026-07-16 16:45 — T002 PASSED 99; first code through all gates
- task: T002 (build, client-dev) — Economy.Core
- result: **PASSED 99/90, round 1.** Gate green: compile 0 CS errors, 55/55 EditMode tests (0.07s).
  C1 30/30 · C2 25/25 · C3 20/20 · C4 14/15 · C5 10/10.
- **this is the whole system working end to end for code**: implementer built it, the mechanical gate
  proved it compiles and its 55 tests pass, the client lead scored observed structure at 99, and it
  cleared in one round. No revise needed — but the revise loop (added Tick 3) was there if it wasn't.
- **verified independently, not just trusted** (tick protocol): 28 .cs files exist, Core has zero
  UnityEngine refs in real code, the D5 curve [0,60,240,720,2000] is present, and
  gate-test-results.xml shows total=55 failed=0. Report matches reality.
- the load-bearing win: the monotonic-clock seam the lead rejected the round-1 SPEC for is now built and
  test-proven — FakeClock fast-forwards 9h in <50ms, so gate/gate.ps1 can genuinely fail on an
  integrity regression. 관문 1 is not decoration on this subsystem.
- committed to lifetown repo: a9238c2, 63 files (26 .cs + their .meta + 2 asmdef), 1548 lines.
  Library/ correctly excluded.
- **flagged to the director**: lifetown has NO git remote — local commits only, so a disk failure loses
  the code. Asked them to create a `lifetown` GitHub repo (like loopteam). Not blocking the build.
- **next**: offered Platform layer (decision-stable, gate-provable) vs art design system, and said I'd
  default to Platform if no answer. Holding one heartbeat for a reply rather than launching another
  25-min build immediately after asking "continue or pause?" — the Monitor wakes on a reply.
- decisions D2/D3/D4/D6/D8/D10 remain on their spec defaults (unanswered = default, not re-opened).

## Tick 8 — 2026-07-16 20:20 — T003 (Platform) launched
- did: Monitor fired on director's 20:18 "계속 진행해. 저장소는 추후에 알려줄게." Scout classified it:
  general go-ahead + repo deferred. No explicit Platform-vs-art pick → PM's stated default (Platform).
- task: T003 (build, client-dev) — LifeTown.Platform. Launched.
- scope: AndroidMonotonicClock (§7.3.1), reboot/tamper detection (§7.3.2, >5000ms drift → clock_untrusted),
  crash-safe SaveFile JSON IO (temp + atomic replace). Additive on T002's Core; no economy math in Platform.
- **testability caveat put in the brief up front**: the gate runs in the editor, not on real Android, so
  AndroidJavaClass returns nothing real there. The reboot/tamper LOGIC must sit behind IMonotonicClock
  (FakeClock-injectable) to be EditMode-testable; the device clock itself only compile-checks. Told the
  lead this so it scores C5 on "is the logic gate-provable", not on "did it run on a phone" (it can't).
  Also reported this limit to the director honestly.
- lifetown remote: still none; director said he'll provide it later. Committing locally, as before.
- note: scout had already created the T003 file and backlog row (good — that is its job); PM only set
  status in-progress and launched. No duplication.

## Tick 9 — 2026-07-16 20:52 — T003 PASSED 99; T004 (art) launched
- task: T003 (build) → **PASSED 99/90 r1.** Gate: compile 0 errors, 81/81 tests (55 Core + 26 Platform).
  Committed 99db431 (33 files). C2 -1 (round-trip on sampled fields, not full equality).
- **verified independently, and a false alarm worth noting**: my grep for §7.4 boundary leaks flagged
  RebootTamperGuard.cs — but the only hit was a DOC-COMMENT (`<see cref="Settlement.CommitRecovered"/>`)
  stating the boundary it does NOT cross. Real code is just `WallMs-ElapsedMs` and `Abs(...) > tol`. The
  lead was right; my grep was coarse. Checked the actual context before trusting the alarm — a coarse
  grep is a lead, not a verdict.
- **milestone**: the decision-stable code spine (Core + Platform) is DONE and gate-proven. 81 tests.
  Two 99/90 builds, both one-round. The gates are working on real code, repeatedly.
- **next = T004 art design system (explore, ui-ux, 아트팀장).** Reasoning: the App layer (screens) is
  now the only forward path, and the village — the payoff screen — is blocked on visual direction. So
  art is the bottleneck. Mode is explore (a design DOC, no Unity code → no mechanical gate, same as
  T001's spec). 3 execution angles WITHIN the locked identity (readability / delight / cohesion) —
  the palette/style are locked, so the divergence is in execution, not identity.
- **flagged to the director**: unlike Core/Platform (decision-stable, my call), the visual direction is
  the game director's domain. Proceeding on "계속 진행해" but explicitly inviting taste input.
- lifetown remote: still none (director will provide). Local commits only.

## Tick 10 — 2026-07-16 20:47 — art blend directive captured (T004 still running)
- did: Monitor fired on director msg 1527280384453115936 (20:46): "1과 2가 적절하게 섞여야해".
- decision: this is taste guidance for the RUNNING T004, not a new task or a stop. Scout correctly went
  IDLE (T004 in-progress, nothing else ready) and captured the guidance without interrupting.
- interpretation: 1=readability, 2=delight (matches the PM's own Discord numbering) → director wants a
  **readability+delight blend**, not a single winning angle. Confirmed the mapping back to the director.
- **how this is handled without wasting the running work**: the explore workflow already returns
  `grafts` (best ideas from the losing angles). So when T004 lands, the winner-handling takes the
  higher-scored of readability/delight as the spine and grafts in the other, rather than shipping one
  angle. The blend is a director instruction → it outranks raw score order. Recorded as a PM directive
  in T004.md. Do NOT restart T004 — steer at completion.
- **why not interrupt**: T004 is ~mid-flight and restarting burns the proposals already generated. The
  blend is a finishing step, not a re-scope. This is the whole point of not blocking/restarting on
  every message.
- pending: confirm the final look with the director via mockups before T004 is done; asked if they want
  a weighting (e.g. 6:4) or an even split.

## Tick 11 — 2026-07-16 21:00 — T004 art system PASSED 92; mockups next
- task: T004 (explore, ui-ux) → **PASSED 92/90 r1.** Cohesion won (92); readability 91, delight 87.
- design doc saved to lifetown/docs/design/00-art-design-system.md (40k), committed 35753fc.
- **the director's blend directive is honored via grafts, not a re-run**: the cohesion winner already
  grafted readability's "Legibility Layer" (identity indicators excluded from Light2D so always legible
  — literally readability's core idea, marked "winner's biggest steal") + delight's night window-glow and
  coin-fly beats. So the deliverable is cohesion-substrate + readability-legibility + delight-charm ≈ the
  1+2 blend the director asked for, on a consistent spine. Honest caveat: cohesion is still the headline,
  so the DIRECTOR judges the actual balance on mockups, not on my say-so.
- **finding (ui-ux caught my brief's error)**: the 7 category hex are NOT in Core — T002 built only
  economy math, no CategoryDef color config exists. The design doc is now the color source of truth.
  Recorded in Do Not Repeat so the App layer doesn't assume Core has colors.
- **next = T005 mockups** for the director's visual sign-off (I promised images). Not a gated task —
  the director is the judge of a mockup, not the art lead. Delegating to ui-ux to build HTML mockups of
  village + timer + receipt in the readability+delight blend; PM renders HTML→PNG (render-html.ps1 +
  Chrome both verified present) and sends to Discord. Render pipeline confirmed working before launch.

## Tick 12 — 2026-07-16 21:15 — mockups rendered, reviewed, sent for director sign-off
- did: Delegated to ui-ux → built 3 self-contained HTML mockups (village/timer/receipt) from the T004
  design system, tuned to the director's readability+delight blend. PM rendered them to PNG
  (render-html.ps1 + Chrome, 390x844 @2x) and **looked at all three before sending** — village's
  inline-script isometric actually rendered (buildings, category colors, tier stages, construction
  ring, HUD), timer and receipt clean, Mongsil present, no red/punitive hues.
- **this is the taste-gate done right**: the director asked to SEE it, not read it. A 40k-char design
  doc is not what a non-technical game director evaluates — pixels are. Sent 3 images + a plain
  "does this direction work? 👍/🔧" so the decision is a glance, not a homework assignment.
- committed mockups to lifetown (454ea03). T005 → awaiting-approval.
- **the loop is now genuinely blocked on the director** — the App-layer screen build needs the visual
  direction confirmed, and that is a taste call only they can make. Nothing else is ready (Core +
  Platform done, spec approved). So the loop idles until they respond. Correct behavior: a taste gate
  is one of the few places an autonomous loop SHOULD wait, because guessing wrong wastes far more than
  waiting.
- verified before sending: mockups self-contained (no external refs — offline render), render pipeline
  present. Sent via send-file.ps1 (images render inline in Discord).

## Tick 13 — 2026-07-16 21:20 — director rejected village mockup (buildings don't read)
- did: Monitor fired on director msg 1527288064743968919 (21:17). Scout classified it correctly as
  ADJUSTMENT, not approval: "건물이 안보여. 누가봐도 건물스럽게... 종류도 다양해야해."
- **the taste gate did its job.** The director looked at pixels and gave concrete, fair feedback: the
  village 'buildings' were colored isometric cubes, not recognizable buildings, and all one shape
  recolored. The loop did NOT proceed to the App build — it revises. Guessing "close enough" here would
  have shipped a village that fails the app's whole "눈에 보이게" purpose.
- task: T005 round 2. Resumed the SAME ui-ux agent (af5f8b50b991546fb) via SendMessage so it keeps the
  design-system + village.html context instead of a cold restart. Scoped to village.html ONLY — timer
  and receipt were not criticized, so they are approved-by-silence and left untouched (don't re-do what
  wasn't flagged).
- direction given: real architectural silhouettes (roof/walls/windows/door), and genuine type variety
  (distinct forms per category, not one cube in 7 colors), keeping the locked palette + tier + ghost
  mechanics.
- next: PM re-renders the revised village.html, reviews it, re-sends for sign-off. Timer/receipt stay.
- note: this is the second useful correction the director has made on a deliverable (first: the 83->93
  spec was the team's own lead; this one is the director on visuals). Both times the system revised
  instead of shipping the first attempt. That is the whole point.

## Tick 14 — 2026-07-16 21:23 — new rule: art-lead-gate visuals before the director
- did: Monitor fired on director msg 1527289220106948708 (21:22): "아트팀장 기준 점수 넘기면 나에게
  보여줘." Scout classified it as a reporting-workflow instruction (not new art, not a stop) and stayed
  IDLE (T005 already in-progress).
- **process correction accepted**: round-1 mockups were sent to the director UNGATED — I had decided
  "the director is the judge of a mockup." The director overruled that: visuals must clear 아트팀장's
  score (90) before reaching them. It is the right call — an art-lead scoring A1-A5 would have caught
  "buildings don't read as buildings" before it cost the director a review cycle. Recorded as a
  standing rule in PROGRESS Decisions and Next Run Should.
- **also fixed a real cockpit rot**: PROGRESS.md's Current State / Last Run / Blockers were STALE from
  tick 4-5 — it still said "PAUSED" and "waiting on D7". At tick 14 that is dangerously wrong: a
  context-reset tick would read "paused" and stop, or chase a resolved blocker. Rewrote those sections
  to tick-14 reality (T001-T004 done, T005 mid-revision, D7 resolved as "defer shipping"). I had been
  appending to the journal + Decisions but letting the cockpit top rot — exactly the failure the file
  warns about. The cockpit must reflect NOW, not accumulate.
- next: when the village revision lands → render → 아트팀장 gate ≥90 → then director. Not before.

## Tick 15 — 2026-07-16 21:45 — village R2 gated at 75 by 아트팀장 → R3
- did: ui-ux round-2 village mockup landed (7 building types with real roofs/doors/windows). PM rendered
  it (village-v2.png) and LOOKED — buildings genuinely read as buildings now, the round-1 cube problem
  is fixed. Then, per the new rule, sent it to 아트팀장 to gate BEFORE the director.
- result: **아트팀장 scored 75/90 — did NOT pass.** The gate did exactly its job: caught real problems
  before spending the director's attention. Deductions: M1 25/30 (yellow building still boxy, details
  near legibility threshold at small scale), M2 14/20 (only ~4 forms visible vs 7 claimed; pink+teal
  share a silhouette), M3 16/20 (coquette identity absent — no ribbon/lace/bow), M4 11/15, M5 9/15
  (~half the canvas is dead space, village cramped small — the weakest row).
- **this validates the director's process instruction.** If I'd sent R2 straight to the director (as I
  did in R1), they'd have burned another review cycle on it. The art lead caught the same "cramped +
  empty" issue I'd noticed and named it the topFix. The gate is worth its cost.
- action: resumed ui-ux for round 3 with the lead's 5 deductions in priority order — topFix first
  (enlarge the village to fill the frame). Did NOT send R2 to the director. R3 will re-gate.
- note on cost: this mockup has now taken ui-ux ~430k tokens over 3 rounds + 2 lead reviews. Worth it
  for the game's visual identity, but if R3 also fails the gate I should consider whether the HTML-mockup
  medium is fighting us (faking isometric buildings in CSS is inherently limited) and whether to move to
  actual Unity sprites sooner rather than perfecting an HTML approximation.

## Tick 16 — 2026-07-16 22:00 — village R3 = 76 (flat); escalating the medium decision
- did: ui-ux R3 landed (enlarged, more forms, coquette, rebuilt construction ghost). PM rendered
  (village-v3.png), looked, sent to 아트팀장. **Score 76/90 — FAIL.** Scores now 75 → 76 = FLAT = the
  no-progress signal (VISION §3.4).
- art lead's read: 4 of 5 buildings read cleanly and real variety now exists (the director's core
  concern IS addressed), but held at 76 on: the pink center building still a roofless cube (a specific
  bug), coquette under-delivered (bow/lace/heart don't read; sparkles+bunting do), and persistent
  lower-center dead space + a central overlap/clutter pile.
- **PM call: do NOT grind round 4 silently.** This is the exact risk I flagged in Tick 15. Reasoning:
  (1) the mockup is a THROWAWAY comms tool — Unity redraws all of it; (2) the director's actual feedback
  (buildings read + variety) is met; (3) the gap to 90 is polish, partly HTML-medium artifacts (faked-
  isometric overlap, fixed-position dead space); (4) scores are flat; (5) ~740k tokens already spent on
  ui-ux rounds + 3 lead reviews for this one mockup. Grinding a throwaway to an artificial 90 is poor
  stewardship.
- **escalated to the director as a decision** (their ≥90 rule vs diminishing returns is theirs to
  resolve): one more targeted micro-fix / glance-approve the direction now at 76 / skip mockup polish
  and build it in Unity for real. Recommended moving to Unity — the mockup already proved the building-
  form direction works.
- **lesson (Do Not Repeat)**: HTML mockups hit diminishing returns against a 90 ART bar because the
  medium fights isometric and a mockup is a comms tool, not a shippable asset. For future visual
  direction: gate mockups at a lower "does it communicate the direction" bar, or go to the real engine
  sooner. Don't apply the shippable-art 90 to a throwaway.

## Tick 17 — 2026-07-16 22:25 — director chose C; T005 dropped, T006 (asset research) launched
- did: Monitor fired on director msg 1527304211208081510 (22:21). Scout: director chose **option C**
  (stop HTML mockup, build in Unity) + a new request — review free Asset Store / GitHub assets, or the
  art team building Fortune City-quality buildings in Unity, before locking the asset approach.
- **escalation resolved by the director**, exactly as intended — I surfaced the medium decision instead
  of grinding, and the director made the call. T005 → dropped (not failed; it proved the building-form
  direction and surfaced the asset question). Escalation cleared from loop.json.
- T006 launched (explore, ui-ux, 아트팀장): 3 angles — Asset Store / GitHub / custom-build — with a
  recommendation for T007. T007 (real Unity village build) created as blocked on T006 so the asset
  choice isn't made twice.
- **fixed a dangerous error in the scout's T006 draft**: it said "no Unity project exists, T007 will
  create it." WRONG — the project exists since Tick 3 with Core+Platform + 81 tests. A future agent
  reading that would create a new project and clobber the code. Corrected to "adds to the existing
  project." This is exactly the kind of stale/wrong state that causes real damage — caught it.
- **two guardrails added to T006**: (1) license claims must be VERIFIED via WebSearch/WebFetch, not
  asserted — a hallucinated free-for-commercial asset is a legal landmine, and A2 is worth 25 points
  and auto-fails on fabrication; (2) Fortune City is a real commercial game — approach-inspiration only,
  never asset-copying. Both because these are the ways this specific research task goes wrong.
- may revisit D6 (in-house geometric). If the research recommends an asset pack, that's a director
  decision — T006 recommends, director approves before T007 commits.

## Tick 18 — 2026-07-16 22:55 — T006 recommends custom ProBuilder (93); reported for steer
- task: T006 (explore, ui-ux) → **PASSED 93/90 r1.** Recommendation: Option C, custom ProBuilder low-poly
  buildings — CONFIRMS D6 (executes it, doesn't reverse it). Doc: lifetown/docs/design/01-asset-strategy.md.
- the research was honestly uncertain where it should be: flagged a Kenney fetch 404 as "high-confidence
  not fetch-verified", and refused to claim a free Asset Store building pack it couldn't confirm. That is
  exactly the A2 behavior the guardrail wanted — scored 24/25.
- why C: paid Store packs don't fit identity + cost reconciliation ~= building it right; free CC0 packs
  (KayKit/Kenney, licenses verified) are "kit soup" identity-drift risk; ProBuilder is Unity's own tool
  (zero license risk) and real 3D geometry gets roof/wall/window for free — solving the T005 "reads as
  blocks" problem that a team with no pixel artist can't reliably fake in 2D.
- **PM decision: did NOT auto-launch T007.** The director asked for this research specifically to decide
  the asset approach, and it's a ~2-week commitment with a real speed/identity tradeoff (a CC0 fallback
  exists). Auto-starting a hard multi-round Unity art build off my own reading of "just build" would be
  presumptuous on a call the director reserved. Reported the recommendation + a "go/no-go spike" plan
  (build ONE building → screenshot → confirm before the full build) and asked them to steer.
- **flagged an honest limit to the director**: from here the loop's gate model weakens — "compiles +
  tests pass" is mechanical, but "does the building look good" needs a screenshot + an eye (art lead +
  director). The spike-first plan is how we keep that judgment cheap: 1 building, not 7, before commit.
- T007 → awaiting-approval (approach decision). Nothing else ready → loop idles for the director.
- note on the session: some of my in-session narration this tick glitched into a repeated filler word;
  the actual deliverables (Discord reports, commits, state) all went through correctly. No work impact.

## Tick 19 — 2026-07-16 23:00 — T007 one-building ProBuilder spike launched
- did: Director approved (msg 1527309652222677103): "직접 제작으로 ㄱㄱ 건물 딱 하나를 먼저 만들어보자."
  Custom ProBuilder + one-building spike, confirmed. Launched T007.
- **hardest task the loop has attempted**: an agent building real 3D building geometry in Unity and
  producing a screenshot, with no ability to visually iterate in the editor. Scoped carefully:
  - build ONE building (library — most distinctive silhouette), ProBuilder, cozy-pastel + one coquette touch
  - a BATCHMODE screenshot pipeline (static RenderPng() via -executeMethod → PNG) — essential, it's the
    only way anyone sees the result headlessly
  - Gate 1 = compiles (that's all mechanical can prove for a visual mesh)
  - **아트팀장 gates the SCREENSHOT** (V1-V5: reads-as-a-building 35 / identity 25 / iso+tier 20 /
    extensibility 10 / real-evidence 10), NOT the client lead — because the whole question is visual,
    and "does it look like a building in our identity" is an art judgment, not code correctness.
- guarded: add under Assets/LifeTown.App/ (new asmdef), do NOT create a new project or break the 81
  existing tests; no editor process left holding the project lock (gate conflict, Do Not Repeat).
- **honest note carried from Tick 18**: this is where the loop's gate model is genuinely strained —
  visual quality isn't mechanically checkable. The spike keeps that judgment cheap (1 building) and the
  art-lead-gates-the-screenshot flow is how we get an objective-ish read before the director's eye.
- after it clears: send the director the screenshot for go/no-go before the full village (7 buildings +
  live Economy.Core data) is scheduled.
- session is very long; my prose has glitched (repeated filler word) intermittently — tool calls,
  commits, and Discord all correct. Flagging in case a future tick sees odd narration in the transcript.

## Tick 20 — 2026-07-16 23:05 — token-economy directive
- Director: "토큰 많이 사용하지 말아줘". Recorded concrete levers in PROGRESS Decisions. Biggest lever: stop spawning a full loop-scout for obvious single messages (handle inline). T007 still running; no new work this tick.
